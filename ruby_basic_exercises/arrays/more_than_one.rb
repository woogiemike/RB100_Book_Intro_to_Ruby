# More Than One

# In the code below, an array containing different types of pets is assigned to pets.

pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']

# Write some code that selects 'fish' and 'lizard' from the pets array - select the two items at the same time. 
# Assign the return value to a variable named my_pets, then print the contents of my_pets as a single string, e.g.:

# I have a pet fish and a pet lizard!

# Make sure you use my_pets to get the words "fish" and "lizard" in that message.

my_pets = pets[2,3]
puts "I have a pet #{my_pets[0]} and a pet #{my_pets[1]}!"
