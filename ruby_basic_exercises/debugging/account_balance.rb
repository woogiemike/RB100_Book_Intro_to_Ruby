# Account Balance
# Time for a check of your financial situation.

# The output of the code below tells you that you have around $70. However, you expected your bank account to have about $238. What did we do wrong? You didn't carry over a starting balance from the previous month.

# Financially, you started the year with a clean slate.

balance = 0

# Here's what you earned and spent during the first three months.
