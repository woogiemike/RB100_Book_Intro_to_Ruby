# Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 3)

# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
  'Dinner'
end

puts meal

# This will print Breakfast.
# Because it was explicitly returned.
# Once the method gets to the return it will stop and return that line. It will not get to line 7.
