# Conditional Loop
# Write an if/else statement that executes some code if the process_the_loop variable is true and some other code when process_the_loop is false. 

# Specifically:
# When process_the_loop is true, execute a loop that iterates exactly once and prints The loop was processed during that iteration.
# When process_the_loop is false, just print The loop wasn't processed!.
# Use the following code to initialize process_the_loop. It will randomly assign the variable to either true or false.

process_the_loop = [true, false].sample

if process_the_loop == true
    loop do
        puts "The loop was processed during that iteration."
        break
    end
else
    puts "The loop wasn't processed!"
end
